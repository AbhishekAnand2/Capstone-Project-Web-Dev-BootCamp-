      <p class="paragraph">
        As an accomplished computer science student and competitive programmer,
        I possess exceptional problem-solving skills that are honed through my
        experience with Python and object-oriented programming. My ultimate goal
        is to excel as a software developer. My skills and expertise are
        reflected by my 3-star rating in Python programming on Hackerrank. I
        have extensive experience working with various Python frameworks such as
        BS4, requests, and Selenium, which I have used to automate tasks like
        website scraping. Furthermore, I have employed Numpy to efficiently
        manage data. I have a sharp eye for detecting problems, and my
        proficiency in solving them is second to none. I am motivated to thrive
        in a challenging environment and take pride in being a fast learner. To
        strengthen my professional capabilities, I have completed certifications
        in Django Essential Training and Advanced Google Analytics. These
        certifications have provided me with valuable industry insights and
        advanced techniques.

                        As an accomplished professional, I am currently overseeing a range of operations on the company's Shopify
                        marketplace. These include, but are not limited to, managing product listings, analyzing sales data, and tracking key
                        performance indicators (KPIs). To perform these tasks, I utilize a variety of tools and resources such as Google Analytics
                        (UA-4) and Shopify Analytics. By leveraging these tools, I am able to assess various dimensions, such as consumer
                        behavior, demographics, conversion goals, and more.
                        Furthermore, I am responsible for on-page search engine optimization (SEO) tasks, which involve updating meta data,
                        conducting keyword research using tools such as ahrefs, and analyzing search engine results pages (SERPs). Additionally,
                        I possess a solid technical foundation in HTML, CSS, and JS, which enables me to make minor and major changes to the
                        marketplace as required.

                        I have also contributed to the development of web crawlers for scraping data from external websites. Moreover, I am
                        accountable for customer support and order fulfillment, ensuring that all inquiries are handled promptly and that
                        orders are fulfilled accurately and efficiently.
